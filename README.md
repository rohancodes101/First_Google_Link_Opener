# First Google Link Opener

This project contains:

1. **A small website** that has numbered buttons (can be cutsomised).
2. **A Chrome extension** that:
   - Automatically bypasses Google's *“Redirect Notice”*.

## Why this exists

Extracting ExamTopics questions manually takes hours.  
This tool automates opening each question link quickly using Google search + a helper extension.

## Contents

- `/extension` — Chrome extension code.  
- `/site` — The HTML page with the question-number grid.

## How to use

1. Open the HTML file in your browser.  
2. Click any question number to search for it.  
3. The Chrome extension handles popups + redirect notices automatically.
